# Central Limit Theorem Project
Generating K=110 independent estimates per sample mean size from 4.2.py, in 5.2.py we are able to determine the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) value and find the maximum absolute difference(MAD) between that and the standard CDF. 
The more independent estimates, the lower the MAD. This entails a more accurate CDF calculation with more independent estimates to base off of.
